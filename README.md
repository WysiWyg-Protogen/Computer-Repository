## Welcome to my Page! (WIP)

Heyo! My name is WysiWyg, and this is my official website to host all of my social media links, community files, wanted items, and more!
This page is currently a work in progress, so check back once in a while for new information!

This is my Redbubble store! I take old, forgotten tshirts, photos from manuals and magazines, or really any 70s and 80s technology graphic and turn them into designs for Mugs, Tshirts, Hoodies, and more! All printings are high quality, and the materials on the items I have ordered have been rather nice considering the price!
