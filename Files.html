# File Archive
Here are a few file archives that I use from time to time! This is most CERTAINLY to expand over time, so be sure to watch out for updates!
### DOS Games Archive
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hncr6q8m3rwnr3a/AACTSjAAqEOL4JLk7We0d6Gda?dl=0" target="_blank">THIS</a> is an archive of nearly ***30 THOUSAND*** MSDOS Games, that have all been cracked or otherwise modified to be able to be installed and ran on any DOS computer. I have found a few of them to be spotty, or requiring some tinkering to get to run right, but I'm assuming you're used to that if you're wanting this archive :P
The files are grouped alphabetically into 6 DVDs, so just download and extract them into a folder and copy them on over!
