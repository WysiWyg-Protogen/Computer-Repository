	<p>As a proud caretaker of nearly <b>50</b> computers, it becomes important that I keep track of their condition, age, and even who owns them!
	I run the Museum of Technology at Middle Georgia State University in Macon Georgia, and we have a lot of machines up there that are owned by the school.
	My job is just to take care of them and create displays for them! More information about the museum can be found 
	<a href="https://www.mga.edu/computing/technology-museum/index.php">here</a>. Many of these computers also have repair and restoration threads on Twitter,
	so be sure to check out the threads page here if you want to see what some of these things have gone through!</p>
